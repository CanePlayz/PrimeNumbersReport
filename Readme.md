# What is this project about?

A simple tool which lets you calculate all prime numbers up to a given number. It uses four different algorithms and generates a report to compare the performance of each algorithm.

# Which algorithms are used?

* Algorithm 1: Check all possible divisors from 2 to n-1 for each number

* Algorithm 2: Check all possible divisors from 2 to sqrt(n) for each number

* Algorithm 3: Check all possible divisors from 2 to sqrt(n) for each number, but skip all even numbers

* Sieve of Eratosthenes
